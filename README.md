# Spring Batch Workshop

## Samples

* hello world: writing "Hello World" on the console
* chunk processing: simple illustration of the chunk processing
* flat file reading: reading from a flat file (and writing to a database)
* skip: skipping a badly formatted line in a CSV file instead of crashing

## Installation instructions

The projects are based on Maven, so any IDE with Maven support should be fine
(import the projects as Maven projects with Eclipse and the M2Eclipse plugin for
example).

## Content

Each Spring Batch topic is covered by two projects: the -start project is
the one you should start from. The -solution is the solution. You just need
to follow the TODOs. The concepts are (quickly) covered in the PDF file
at the root of this project. The PDF contains additional instructions and hints to
work on the projects.
